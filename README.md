# Gif Search

<p>This is an application that utilizes Giphy to generate various gifs based on selected topics.</p>

<p>The application features several buttons concerning topics that are of interest to me. However, you can add any topic that you would like by entering it in the field and selecting "Add Topic." Selecting any of the buttons in the top left will generate 10 gifs. You can click on each gif to animate it from its static position and back again. Enjoy!</p>
